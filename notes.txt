* date parsing issues.

we can parse '2015-12-25' successfully but timeout before sending response.
    return statement in wrong place

if we get '1451001600000', how can we know to parse that as a number?

string in: {"unix":1451001600000,"utc":"Fri, 25 Dec 2015 00:00:00 GMT"}
number in: {"unix":1451001600000,"utc":"Fri, 25 Dec 2015 00:00:00 GMT"}
